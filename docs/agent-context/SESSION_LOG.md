# Shared Agent Session Log

Append-only operational handoffs. Do not store secrets, passwords, tokens, service keys, or customer PII here.

- Goal: establish one canonical repository-based knowledge/handoff layer for all authorized agents.
- Changed: added root `AGENTS.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `OPERATING_RULES.md`, and `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Verified: current Super Kitchen work includes secure cutover, UI polish, and Phase 2A Kitchen Dashboard; protected staff login is working in preview; repository has permanent security/build guardrails.
- Not verified / blockers: persistent Telegram command-bot host still needs to be treated as a separate runtime and verified independently; do not infer it from Mini App availability.
- Security or rollback notes: no secrets are stored in the knowledge base; agents must use scoped credentials and PR workflows.
- PR/issue/commit: knowledge branch `agent-knowledge-base-v1`; Phase 2 epic #17; Kitchen #18; Admin #19; operations #20; KDS PR #21.
- Next safe action: merge this documentation-only knowledge layer, then configure Hermes with a repository-scoped GitHub credential and have it read `AGENTS.md` at startup.
