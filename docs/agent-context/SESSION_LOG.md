# Shared Agent Session Log

Append-only operational handoffs. Do not store secrets, passwords, tokens, service keys, or customer PII here.

- Goal: establish one canonical repository-based knowledge/handoff layer for all authorized agents.
- Changed: added root `AGENTS.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `OPERATING_RULES.md`, and `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Verified: current Super Kitchen work includes secure cutover, UI polish, and Phase 2A Kitchen Dashboard; protected staff login is working in preview; repository has permanent security/build guardrails.
- Not verified / blockers: persistent Telegram command-bot host still needs to be treated as a separate runtime and verified independently; do not infer it from Mini App availability.
- Security or rollback notes: no secrets are stored in the knowledge base; agents must use scoped credentials and PR workflows.
- PR/issue/commit: knowledge branch `agent-knowledge-base-v1`; Phase 2 epic #17; Kitchen #18; Admin #19; operations #20; KDS PR #21.
- Next safe action: merge this documentation-only knowledge layer, then configure Hermes with a repository-scoped GitHub credential and have it read `AGENTS.md` at startup.

- Goal: give Hermes useful operational visibility without handing the VPS a Supabase service-role key or production mutation authority.
- Changed: created `superkitchen-ops` as a separate GET-only Edge Function, added `agent_observer` authorization, added `scripts/hermes-ops-check.mjs`, documented `HERMES_ACCESS.md`, and added permanent CI guards for JWT verification, PII exclusion, read-only behavior, and service-role exclusion from the Hermes client.
- Verified: Supabase deployed `superkitchen-ops` version 1 as ACTIVE with `verify_jwt=true`; deployment compilation succeeded. Live `superkitchen` was reported as version 27 during the same infrastructure check.
- Not verified / blockers: a dedicated Hermes Supabase Auth user has not yet been created, so an authorized end-to-end observer request is still pending. This execution environment could not make the external HTTP smoke request because outbound DNS was unavailable; do not claim that network test passed.
- Security or rollback notes: customer/order function was not modified; no database schema was changed; observer endpoint contains no mutation routes and no customer PII fields. Rollback is isolated to disabling/removing `superkitchen-ops`.
- Branch: `agent-observer-access-v1`.
- Next safe action: create a dedicated Supabase Auth user for Hermes, assign protected `app_metadata.role=agent_observer`, configure only that account plus the publishable key on the VPS, run `node scripts/hermes-ops-check.mjs`, then merge this branch if CI is green.
